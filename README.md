# Resources for my SMP

Install Fabric for 1.16.4 and copy the `mods` folder into `.minecraft`. Also, put `offlineskins.json` into `.minecraft/config`.  
Of course, you can install additional mods yourself like Optifabric/Optifine or a minimap mod, but these are needed to take full advantage of the server's QoL features.  
_Appleskin_ lets you see more detailed info on hunger.  
_OfflineSkins_ pings this GitHub server and gets skins for people without accounts.  
_Reroll_ lets you change enchantments for better ones in the Enchantment Table.  
_ModMenu_ lets you see the mods running.

The server has some mods that you don't need to have installed yourself.  
_BetterThanMending_ makes it so you can keep your XP levels and mend things manually.  
_SilkySpawners_ allows you to pick up monster spawners to farm.  
_TrampleDisabler_ makes it so you can't break farmland by walking on it.

Finally, there are 3 datapacks on the server that you don't need to install either.  
_info_horse_ shows the stats of horses when you ride them.  
_leash-villager_ lets you leash villagers.  
_Recipes+_ adds handy recipes, like dyeing beds, crafting bells, saddles, and nametags.
