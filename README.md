# Resources for my SMP

Install [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) for 1.16.5, either through their website or from within MultiMC, and copy both the `mods` and `config` folder into `.minecraft`.  
If you'd like to add a mod to the server, or if you have problems setting something up, hmu

Mods starting with `GAME` are to do with game content or general feature-adding, `QOL` are quality-of-life mods, `LIB` are libraries or add-ons for other mods, and `OPT` are game optimization mods that allow Minecraft to run at over 3FPS.

The SMP server is hosted in Offline Mode, meaning you _don't_ need an account to play. Skins are handled by the Offline Skins mod and link here - if you'd like to change your skin or cape, DM me.  
I highly recommend using [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) to manage your Minecraft & Fabric installations, or if you don't have a legit account, [UltimMC](https://github.com/AfoninZ/MultiMC5-Cracked/).
